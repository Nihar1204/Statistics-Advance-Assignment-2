    "# Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "# The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which are variables that can only take on specific, isolated values.\n",
    "# It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n",
    "# The PMF is represented as a function that maps each possible value of the random variable to its probability.\n",
    "# Mathematically, if X is a discrete random variable, the PMF of X, denoted as P(X), is defined as P(X = x), where x \n",
    "# is a specific value of X.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Consider the roll of a fair six-sided die. The PMF for this scenario would assign probabilities to each possible outcome \n",
    "# (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Since each outcome has an equal chance of occurring (assuming the die is fair), the PMF for this \n",
    "# situation would be:P(X = 1) = 1/6,... , P(X = 6) = 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "# The PDF is used for continuous random variables, which are variables that can take on any value within a certain range.\n",
    "# Unlike the PMF, which assigns probabilities to specific values, the PDF gives the relative likelihood that a continuous\n",
    "# random variable falls within a particular interval.\n",
    "# The PDF is represented as a function that describes the distribution of probabilities over the entire range of possible\n",
    "# values.\n",
    "# The probability of a continuous random variable falling within a specific interval is given by the area under the PDF \n",
    "# curve over that interval.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Consider the height of adult males in a certain population. The PDF for this scenario might follow a normal (Gaussian)\n",
    "# distribution, with most heights clustering around the mean. The PDF curve would describe the likelihood of observing \n",

    "# For x=1: F(1) = F(X<=1) = 1/6, For x=2: F(2) = F(X<=2) = 2/6 = 1/3 ... For x=6: F(6) = F(X<=6) = 6/6 = 1\n",
